1. Thanks for the purchase!

2. Some general information, I left notes in every folder in case you get lost :)

3. Ignore all the yellow error messages in the demo scenes! They are most likely caused by the mesh brush tool I was using to make the scene after I removed it from the pack or they might be general Unity version compile errors.

4. For more information regarding the assets follow this thread:

Or contact me via email: florianalexandru05@gmail.com

5. Remember to turn on instancing on materials yourself and add post-processing!

6. Please make sure that your project is set to use the linear color space in Edit -> Project Settings -> Player.

7. In case the 4k textures get reverted to 2k, set them to 4k manually (left a 4k texture list in the notes)!

8. Please don't change the mesh normal, all meshes have custom vertex normals applied, if changed, the normal maps won't work properly!

9. Enjoy making a fabulous dungeon! 
---------------------

*General Information*

AAA dungeon art pack for games. Most textures are made using Substance Designer so there is little to non, photo source material containing mostly 4k texture atlases. Mostly an inside modular art package, the outside scene is more for aesthetic reasons. There are no trees in the pack yet but they will be included on the next update along with possible "HD Render pipeline" support. Keep an eye out for future updates!!
